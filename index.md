## Agile Delivery Manager | IT Project Manager | AI-Enabled Execution

I am a delivery-focused Project Manager with 10+ years of experience leading complex technology initiatives across healthcare, automotive, retail, and food industries. I help organizations deliver confidently in regulated, enterprise environments by combining strong governance with practical, people-first execution.

I’ve worked extensively with stakeholders across Canada and the U.S., owning portfolios in the $1M–$3M range and leading cross-functional teams through change with clarity and accountability.

## 👋 Professional Overview

Throughout my career, I’ve been trusted to step into complex programs, stabilize delivery, and help teams meet their commitments — without unnecessary overhead. My approach is grounded in transparency, early risk identification, and strong collaboration between business, technology, and vendor partners.

I bring a calm, structured leadership style, particularly valuable in environments where privacy, compliance, and audit readiness are non-negotiable. More recently, I’ve been incorporating AI-assisted tools responsibly to improve reporting quality, forecasting, and decision support while maintaining full human oversight.

## 🎯 What I’m Known For

- Leading delivery using SAFe, Agile, Hybrid, and Waterfall models  
- Establishing governance that supports delivery rather than slows it down  
- Aligning executives, business partners, engineering teams, and vendors  
- Improving predictability through disciplined planning and data signals  
- Creating clarity in ambiguous or high-pressure situations  
- Supporting teams through change with empathy and accountability

## 🤖 Practical Use of AI & Data

I approach AI as a **delivery enabler**, not a replacement for judgment.

In my work, AI has been used to:
- Accelerate reporting and documentation with human review
- Improve forecast accuracy using trend and dependency analysis
- Reduce manual effort through automation of repeatable tasks
- Support better decision-making while respecting privacy and compliance requirements
- Pilot AI-enabled solutions responsibly within enterprise controls

This approach aligns well with Canadian enterprise expectations around trust, ethics, and risk management.
